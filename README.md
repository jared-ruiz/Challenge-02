# Challenge-02
## Challenge 02- Begin On-Going Portfolio Website Creation

For the second challenge of my bootcamp, I am beginning to create the website that will serve as my personal area for my resume, my current project information, and more. 
<br>
<br>

## Criteria to be considered complete (Feb. 2022)

- WHEN I load their portfolio
> THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
> THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
> THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
> THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
> THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
> THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
<br>
<br>


I plan for this website to serve as an evolving reminder of my knowledge of html, css, and more. 
Hopefully, by the end of this experience I will have a genuinley interesting piece to show you all. Thank you for your time!
